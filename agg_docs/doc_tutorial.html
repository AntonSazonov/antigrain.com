   It is not a traditional tutorial, it does not begin with the simplest "Hello World!" 
   program, but instead, it will guide you from the lowest level classes and functions of AGG 
   to more complex ones (without getting into the details, however). This way is easier 
   to understand the idea and the architecture of the library. AGG is designed to be
   as open library as possible. Almost any part of it can be endlessly extended
   without changing the existig code. The main idea of AGG is not to provide 
   a fully functional monster-looking graphic interface, but provide a number of small
   independent (or almost independent) parts that help you to construct 
   your own interfaces very easily. So, you won't find in the library a class like 
   "Graphics" that has hundreds of functions Get/Set, Line, Circle, and so on. 
   However, the capabilities of AGG are unique because you can create your own classes and 
   embed them into the library in the most natural way. You can control, for example, the 
   issue of who, when, where, and what has the responsibility for conversion from world 
   to device coordinates. You can also add your own unique rendering classes, that, 
   for example, can perform Phong shading.

   <h1>1. Rendering Buffer</h1>
   <p align="justify">
   AGG is a 2D rendering library that works with a buffer in memory. Strictly speaking 
   it's not quite right, AGG can work with almost any drawing interface, but for now let us 
   think so in order not to get into details right away. Besides, rendering
   with buffer is the primary technique in AGG because it guarantees the highest possible 
   quality of the resulting images. <br><br>
   The buffer is a rendering canvas that consists of pixels. Pixels can be of different formats, 
   depending on the architecture where AGG is used. Below are the examples of some popular pixel 
   formats (but not all of them).<br>
   </p>
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../img/color_format_examples.gif">
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Again, pixel format is not a restriction, in fact it can represent even different color 
   spaces, for example, CMYK. But you will have to display the rendered image afterwards and if
   the buffer format (or color space) is different from the one used in your system, you will
   have to convert it before displaying every time, which can be too expensive and kill the
   performance. 
   </p>

   <p align="justify">
   Since the library does not depend on any particular platform or
   architecture it was decided that it's your responsibility 
   to create and destroy rendering buffers properly. You can use
   any available mechanism to create it - system API functions, 
   simple memory allocation, or even statically defined array.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   The first class AGG starts with is <b>agg::render_buffer</b>. It's a very simple class 
   that does not even allocate memory for the rendering buffer. What is it needed for? 
   Let's start with an example:
   </p>
   <pre>
 // Suppose we work with 24-bit B-G-R True Color, 
 // and allocate memory for the buffer 95x95 pixels.
 // In many systems the length of the rows in bytes
 // must be aligned to some power of 2 value. In Windows
 // it's 4 bytes. So, we have to calculate the length of 
 // the row in bytes, considering the alignment. 

 unsigned int row_bytes = (95 * 3 + 3) / 4 * 4;
 unsigned char* buf = new unsigned char[95 * row_bytes];

 agg::render_buffer rbuf;
 rbuf.attach(buf, 95, 95, int(row_bytes));
   </pre>
   <p align="justify">
   Here we allocated the buffer, created an object of <b>agg::render_buffer</b> and 
   attached the allocated memory to it. The object <b>rbuf</b> is ready to work. 
   But it does not know anything about the pixel format and it does not 
   control the memory we've just allocated, we will have to <b>delete [] buf</b>
   when the work is done. But the class provides a very useful function
   <b>get_row(y)</b> which returns a pointer to the row with coordinate <b>y</b>.
   The class can do that because it knows the length of the row in bytes. 
   The coordinates of any pixel can be calculated by the formula:
   </p>
   <p align="center">
   <b>pix_ptr = buf + y * row_bytes + x * pix_bytes</b>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Where <b>row_bytes</b> - number of bytes per row, <b>pix_bytes</b> - 
   number of bytes per pixel. 
   But <b>agg::render_buffer</b>, when its method <b>attach()</b> is called, precalculates 
   the pointers for every row in order to avoid one extra multiplication when
   rendering. The adresses of pixels will be calculated very often, so, it 
   saves you some time.
   </p> 
   <p align="justify">
   But not only the performance matters here, it gives you flexibility. 
   First, the value <b>row_butes</b> can be positive or negative. If it's positive,
   the pixel rows start from the beginning of the buffer and grow as the 
   addresses in memory inrease. The negative value means that the rows start from
   the end of it (in fact, from its last row) and increasing Y means
   decreasing the addresses in memory. In other words, the image will be 
   flipped vertically, and it allows you to change the direction of the Y 
   coordinate very easily. Considering this possibility, precalculation of the 
   addresses becomes more meaningful. 
   </p>
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../img/render_buffer_row_len.gif">
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Second, you can attach <b>agg::render_buffer</b> to any part of a larger allocated buffer. 
   In this case you will have to calculate the address where the buffer starts by yourself.
   For example, suppose we have a buffer 1024 x 1024. We can easily attach an object 
   of <b>agg::render_buf</b> of size 256 x 256, starting from coordinate (512,512) to this very 
   buffer (suppose, we have the same 24-bit pixel format):
   </p>
   <pre>
 unsigned int row_bytes = (1024*3 + 3) / 4 * 4;
 unsigned char* start_buf = buf_1024x1024 + 512 * row_bytes + 512*3;

 agg::render_buffer rbuf;
 rbuf.attach(buf, 128, 128, int(row_bytes));
   </pre>

<table align="center" width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p align="justify">
   <img src="../img/render_buffer_attach.gif" align="left">
   Note, that we use value <b>row_bytes</b> calculated for buffer 1024x1024.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Class <b>agg::render_buffer</b> does not know anything about the pixel format, but the 
   value <b>row_bytes</b> is all it needs to maintain Y-positioning. Also,
   this class has functions <b>set_clipbox()</b> and <b>get_clipbox()</b> that 
   used for low level clipping in the rendering classes. 
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   The cost of creation objects of this class is very little and one can 
   afford to do create and destroy them every time the drawing event in your 
   system occures.
   </p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
   <p align="justify">
   Class <b>agg::render_buffer</b> also has functions of setting the clipping box:
   <b>set_clipbox</b> and <b>get_clipbox</b>. It does not do anything except storing
   the coordinates of the clipbox. The reason to place the clipbox coordinates into 
   this class is that only <b>agg::render_buffer</b> knows the width and the 
   height of the buffer and it performs clipping the clipbox if you try to set 
   it larger than the actual size of the buffer.
   </p>


<hr color="#3399ff">
   <h1>2. Base Rendering Classes</h1>

   <p align="justify">
   Since <b>agg::render_buffer</b> does not know anything about the pixel format
   there must be something that does. It's a set of classes <b>agg::render_XXXX</b> where
   <b>XXXX</b> is the abbreviation of the particular pixel format served by this base class, 
   for example, <b>render_bgr24</b> is designed to work with 24-bit pixels whose 
   components have order Blue-Green-Red in memory. These classes don't have any 
   common base class and they can have any drawing functionality. Basically they 
   should have very simple utility functions such as <b>clear, rectangle, get_pixel, 
   put_pixel, copy_from</b>. The constructors of this classes require a pointer to
   an object of <b>agg::render_buffer</b>. But what if
   we created a grayscale-buffer with 1 byte per pixel and pass it to the 
   <b>render_bgr24</b> class? Nothing. There's no way to check if your 
   buffer corresponds to your rendering class. It's also your responsibility, but 
   it's not painful. Otherways we had to use some enumeration of a sort of "graphic
   modes" and so, initially restrict the capabilities of adding new pixel formats
   and color spaces. 
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Although these classes seem to have the same fuctionality, they do not have any 
   base class and they are not polymorhic ones. There're three reasons of doing so:
   <ul>
    <p><li>They can have very different data representation and different color sematics
    and although, the signature of their methods are the same the semantics of the 
    color parameter can be completely different. Particulary, function <b>copy_from</b>
    that copies a rectangular area of the image from another one accepts only pointer
    to the same class. Otherways we would have to implement at the very beginning the 
    converters from all other formats and color spaces.
    </li></p>

    <p><li>Most probably you will work with only one format and in some 
    exceptional cases you will need two, so, actually there's no strict neccessity 
    of polymorphism, at least at this very low level.</li></p>

    <p><li>The general approach in AGG is to provide a set of very simple
    utility classes with no virtuals and then, to use thin polymorphic wparrer 
    classes if necessary. Maybe it looks not very familiar but it this case 
    makes sence.</li></p>
   </ul>

   <p align="justify">
   This set of classes is not used for rendering directly because they have
   very poor set of functions (they even don't have to have any). Before we learn
   what classes are actually used for rendering we need to mention about a 
   special class <b>agg::scanline</b>. Although this class is not seen in applications
   it plays a very important role of transfering pixel data in the low level 
   of the library.
   </p>


<hr color="#3399ff">
   <h1>3. Scanline Container</h1>

   <p align="justify">
   The primary rendering techique in AGG is to generate a number of scanlines that will
   be superimposed on the pixel buffer. A scanline is simply an array of bytes whose 
   values determine the brightness of the corresponding pixels. Value 0 means there no 
   changes will be done (absolut transparency), value 255 means complete opacity. 
   Intermediate values determine half-transparency. Scanline does not have any other 
   information, such as color, so, this is the responsibility of the scanline renderers to 
   interpret the values of the scanline. For the sake of performance the scanline container 
   keeps only values greater than 0, thus the scanline consists of a number of non-zero spans.
   </p>
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../img/scanline.gif">
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Class <b>agg::scanline</b> is an internal class, it's used in <b>agg::polyfill</b> 
   and in each of scanline rendering classes. This chapter gives you only common 
   information about the library design. You will need to learn the functionality of 
   this class only if you intend to write your own scanline renderer. 
   The main idea of using scanlines is to specify only the pixel transparency value, but
   not the concrete attributes, such as colors. It can seem silly, because color is a 
   fundamental attribute of graphics. But it's not because color can be represented in 
   different color spaces, and, most of all, color is not the only attribute that can
   be used in a particular scanline renderer. For example, it can be a texture image. 
   The following sections describe how scanlines are used to render color images,
   images with color stencils, and textures with affine transformations.
   </p>



<hr color="#3399ff">
   <h1>4. Scanline Rendering Classes</h1>

   <p align="justify">
   Scanline rendering classes must have the only member function <b>render(scanline* sl).</b>
   All af them are derived from the respective <b>render_XXXX</b> ones.
   Take for example class <b>render_bgr24_solid</b>.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    The concept is that we have to combine high performance with keeping
    good flexibility. Suffix <b>_solid</b> means that the only thing the class
    can do is to render scanlines of one color. It mixes colors of
    the the edge pixels of polygons in order to perform anti-aliasing,
    as well as it has alpha-blending functionality but the main color is only one.
    Color gradients, images, and so on are not supported by this class. 
    The class does not have any if-else logic and when you need only
    single color polygon rendering there's no overhead for analysis
    of the current settings (function <b>render</b> is called very often).
    But what if you need, say, color gradient filling? It's supposed to be
    another class, say, <b>render_XXXX_gradient</b> that works slower than its
    <b>_solid</b>, analog but can perform color interpolation. For image 
    transformations there's a separate class <b>render_XXXX_image</b> and so on. 
    The idea is that creating/destroying renderer classes costs nothing - 
    there're no massive memory operations, so you can use any number of your renderers
    to superimpose their results on you canvas (<b>render_buffer</b>) that's attached
    to a single framebuffer (or can be attached to different ones). 
    Although all these classes are derived from one base class, they are not 
    polymorphic and don't use virtual functions. From the point of view of dogmatic
    polymorphism this solution is wrong, because if you delete an object of 
    the <b>render_XXXX</b> class while actually it points to a derived one you 
    can obtain memory leaks if your derived class allocates some memory. 
    But it is too attractive to have a number of simple service functions in any 
    rendering class.
   </p>

   <p align="justify">
   Besides, scanline rendering classes have a number of quite different settings,
   for example, class <b>render_XXXX_solid</b> requires only color as an
   attribute, <b>render_XXXX_gradient</b> has to use more complicated structures
   of the gradient function configuration, <b>render_XXXX_image</b> needs a pointer
   to another <b>render_XXXX</b> class plus a transformation matrix, and so on.
   </p>

   <p align="justify">
   The general design pattern of the scanline rendering classes is:

<hr color="#3399ff">
   <h1>5. Rasterizing Polygons</h1>

   <p align="justify">
   The only low-level primitive in AGG is a polygon rendered using two classes: 
   <b>agg::scanline</b> and a special polygon rasterization class <b>agg::polyfill</b>.
   All other primitives, even single line segments are based on it. It also can 
   look unreasonable, why do we need these difficulties? The thing is that the 
   rasterizer can perfectly process any polygons even representing very thin lines of
   width less than one pixel. Of cource, it's impossible to draw anything of 
   size less than a pixel, but the rasterizer simulates it with brightness fading.
   An example:
   </p>

<pre>
 double d = 0.0;
 double t = 0.3;
 int i;
 agg::path_storage path;
 for(i = 0; i < 20; i++)
 {
     path.remove_all();
     path.move_to(20+d, 20);
     path.line_to(50+d, 200);
     agg::conv_polyline< agg::path_storage > pline(&path);
     pline.set_thickness(t);
     agg::make_polygon(&pf, &pline, 0);
     agg::render_polygon(&r, &pf);
     d += 29.66;
     t += 0.31;
 }
</pre>
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../img/line_thickness.gif">
   </p>



   <p align="justify">
   This example uses pixel coordinates and renders 20 line segments of 
   different width - 0.31, 0.62, 0.93, 1.24 and so on. Besides, the step 
   of the lines is not a multiple of one. Still, the width changes very gradually 
   and the result looks absolutely consistent with what we could expect. 
   <br>
   <br>
   Another example:
   </p>

<img src="../img/subpixel_accuracy1.gif" align="right">
<pre>
 double t = 0.3;
 double rd = 0.1;
 double r2 = 20.0;
 double a = 0.0;
 int i;
 agg::ellipse ellipse;
 for(i = 0; i < 500; i++)
 {
     double x = cos(a) * r2;
     double y = sin(a) * r2;
     ellipse.init(200+x, 200+y, rd, rd, 16);
     agg::make_polygon(&pf, &ellipse, 0);
     agg::render_polygon(&r, &pf);
     t += 0.2376;
     rd += 0.009443;
     r2 += 0.23;
     a += 5.87765 * agg::pi / 180.0;
 }
</pre>

   <p align="center">
   <img src="../img/subpixel_accuracy1.gif">

-->

   <p align="justify">
   The examples are not complete, there're two strange variables <b>pf</b> and <b>r</b>.
   <b>pf</b> is that very polygon rasterizer <b>agg::polyfill</b>, <b>r</b> - 
   renderer class. 
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
   Let's take a closer look inside the function <b>agg::make_polygon</b>
   </p>
<pre>
 template< class Polygon, class VertexSource >
 void make_polygon(Polygon* pf, 
                   VertexSource* vs, 
                   unsigned start)
 {
     double x;
     double y; 

     pathflag_e flag;
     vs->reset_iterator(start);
     while((flag = vs->next_vertex(&x, &y)) != pathflag_stop)
     {
         if(flag == pathflag_move_to) 
         {
             pf->move_to(poly_coord(x), poly_coord(y));
         }
         else 
         {
             pf->line_to(poly_coord(x), poly_coord(y));
         }
     }
 }
</pre>
   <p align="justify">
   As you can see the function is very simple. Let's leave for now 
   what are <b>reset_iterator</b>, <b>next_vertex</b>, and so on and 
   notice that the only thing this function does is to convert the 
   coordinates from <b>double</b> to some internal ones and calls
   <b>Polygon</b>'s functions <b>move_to</b> and <b>line_to</b>.
   The function is a template one, and in fact, any class that
   has an interface of only two functions
   </p>
<pre>
 void move_to(int x, int y);
 void line_to(int x, int y);
</pre>
   <p align="justify">
   can be used as a polygon rasterizer. Polygon rasterizer must be as optimized
   as possible, so it's inappropriate to work with floating points inside it. 
   It uses fixed point coordinates represented with subpixel accuracy in format
   24.8 (24 bits for the integer part and the sign, 8 bits for the fractional part).
   This format is quite sufficient to have good subpixel accuracy.
   The conversion from the floating point pixel coordinates looks like this:
   </p>
<pre>
 inline int poly_coord(double c)
 {
     return int(c * 256.0);
 }
</pre>
   <p align="justify">
   Why pixel coordinates in floating point format are used here? 
   There're two reasons: 
   </p>

   <ul>
    <p><li>
     To have a possibility to control where and when the world coordinates are converted
     to device ones and not to hide this very important conversion deep inside. 
    </li></p>
    <p><li>
     To use subpixel accuracy and not to round off the coordinates to integers
     as many graphic interfaces do, still keeping integer arithmetic inside.
    </li></p>
   </ul>
 

   <p align="justify">
   The other function used in our example, <b>agg::render_polygon</b>, makes 
   the polygon produce scanlines. Making the long story short, we can say that
   rendering is performed in two steps. We won't look at it now, because it's
   much more complicated and uses some specifics of the polygon rasterizer. Just
   keep in mind that function <b>agg::render_polygon</b> produces scanlines.
